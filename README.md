# Production and Detection of Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) Signals

This is a course project of DSP, Year 3, UESTC & Glasgow Joint School.  

Generate and compose 2 waves with two different frequencies and detect them.

## Generate

1. By sin() & cos() directly.
2. By digital oscillator.

## Detect

1. By fft() directly.
2. By the Goertzel Algorithm.

## Software
